# Sales-Dashboards
Some sample sales and Distribution Dashboards in Power BI and Tableau.

First is the sales distribution dashboard which was created in Power Bi :
✨ I created a sales distribution dashboard highlighting total and monthly sales with Region wise sales and also geographical sales distribution of the data.
✨ The dashboard also displays Top 3 customers of the total sales and Product-wise sales of the business.

Second is the dashboard of walmart retail analysis which was created in Tableau :
✨ I created a dashboard highlighting profit trends by showing the distribution of average profit per state to analyze which state is generating more of an average profit and which state is experiencing loss in Walmart sales.
✨ The dashboard also displays average sales, discounts, and highlights the quarterly average profit in each region to identify possible trends there as well.
